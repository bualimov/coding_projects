# coding_projects ✏️📈 
Hi! 👋 Attached, you’ll find programming projects that I’ve worked on or am currently working on. I’m learning various programming languages and applying different data analysis tools like Pandas and SQL. The goal of this repo is to steadily improve my coding skills, expand my knowledge, and store everything in one place. <br> <br>

Aside from using Python for a few Jupyter Notebook projects, I am most proficient in Java and aim to build my own fully functioning app with both backend and frontend functionality. I’m excited to apply my critical thinking and creativity to bring this project to life. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
